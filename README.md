Some python functions that were useful for simple supervised learning algorithms (scikit-learn).

See example usage in MBA_admissions data set (linear/logistic regression), which is a table of people's experience, gender, profession, etc., which can be used to predict various MBA-related scores. See example usage for decision trees and ensemble methods using Blood_transfusions data set.
